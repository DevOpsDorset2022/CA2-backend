# CA3-backend
For our CA3-backend project, our task was to create a test class for an existing full stack web application using Python, Django, and MySQL, which could perform CRUD operations. Since we had already created such functionality in our previous assessments, we decided to extend our test class to test models and views due to time constraints.

While we did not have the opportunity to test APIs and Forms, we did install the coverage package to analyze the testing coverage and generate reports on our application. The coverage report showed that our application had achieved a 95% coverage.

To ensure that our testing was reliable and independent, we created and point, on the setting file, to a separate database to execute the test cases. This approach allowed us to test our application in isolation, without any interference from external factors.
